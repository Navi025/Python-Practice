# Q12. Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and
# performs the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
# division, and modulus. Display the results.

# a=int(input("First no. = "))
# b=int(input("Second no. = "))
# print("Addition Result = ",a+b)
# print("Substraction Result = ",a-b)
# print("Multiplication Result = ",a*b)
# print("Division Result = ",a/b)
# print("Modulous Result = ",a%b)


# Q13. Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables without
# using a temporary variable.

# x=5
# y=34
# print(f"x = {x}")
# print(f"y = {y}")

# x,y=y,x

# print(f"x = {x}")
# print(f"y = {y}")

# Q14. Write a Python program to calculate the compound interest for a
# given principal, rate of interest, and time period. Ask everything from the
# user

# print("Calculating Simple Interest")
# p=int(input("Enter Principal Amount = "))
# t=float(input("Enter time in years = "))
# r=float(input("rate if interest per annum = "))
# si=(p*t*r)/100
# print(f"Simple Interest = {si}")

# Q15. Write a Python program that takes the radius of a circle as input and
# calculates its area. Use the formula: Area = 3.14 * r^2.

print("***Calculating radius o fthe circle***")
r=float(input("Enter radious of the circle = "))
ar=3.14*r**2
print(f"Radius = {ar}")
